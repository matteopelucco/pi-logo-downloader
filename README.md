## Virtual Env
A good practice in Python Projects is the usage of Virtual Environments

Starting from the project root folder, create a new Virtual Environment with the command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Then yoo can activate the Virtual Environment with the command:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate #on windows
source venv/bin/activate #on mac / linux
```
and deactivate it with the command: 
```bash
deactivate
```
